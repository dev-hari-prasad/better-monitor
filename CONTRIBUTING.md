# Contributing to Better Monitor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Better Monitor! We want this project to be a welcoming place for developers to learn, build, and improve their skills.

This repository is designed to be a **good starting point** for folks looking to get into open source or learn about browser extension development.

## 📝 How to Contribute

1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Look for existing issues or open a new one to discuss what you want to change.
2.  **Open an Issue First:** If you want to add a feature or fix a bug, please **open an issue first**. This ensures we don't duplicate work and allows us to discuss the implementation.
3.  **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repository and clone it locally.
4.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Open a PR referencing the issue you created (e.g., "Closes #123").

## 🤖 AI Policy

**We focused on learning and building.**

While we understand that AI tools (like Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) are helpful assistants, we **avoid purely AI-generated PRs**. 

*   **AI-Assisted (✅ OK):** You use AI to explain a concept, find a bug, or suggest a syntax fix, but you understand the code, refactor it, and integrate it manually.
*   **AI-Generated (❌ Avoid):** You copy-paste an entire block of code or a whole feature generated by an LLM without understanding the underlying logic or ensuring it fits the project's architecture.

Our goal is to build this extension together and understand *how* it works. Please ensure you can explain your code in the PR description.

## Code Style

*   This project uses **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.
*   Keep it simple. We aim to maintain **zero dependencies**.
*   Keep the UI clean and consistent with the existing design.

Happy coding!
