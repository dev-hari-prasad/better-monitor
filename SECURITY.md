# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this project is in an early stage, only the latest version on the `main` branch is supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. Since this is a zero-dependency extension, the attack surface is minimal, but we appreciate your vigilance.

If you discover a security vulnerability or a serious issue:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue or Pull Request.**
2.  Please email the maintainer directly at: **webdev.byhari@gmail.com**

Please include:
*   A description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the issue.
*   Any potential impact.

We will review your report and get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for helping keep Better Monitor safe!
